# fleetd

`fleetd` is a local-first control plane for software agents that need to talk to
each other and keep working across process restarts.

The foundation is deliberately small: durable agent identities, bounded
channels, immutable messages, cursor-based replay, live WebSocket streams, and
leased agent inboxes that resume after worker crashes. It does not host Git,
understand a particular model harness, or require a federated identity protocol.

## Run it

```sh
cargo run -- serve --db .fleetd/fleetd.db
```

The daemon creates `.fleetd/operator.token` with owner-only permissions. The CLI
uses it automatically for administrative commands. In another terminal,
register two agents and save their credentials directly to private files:

```sh
cargo run -- agent add --name piler --metadata '{"harness":"dsh"}' \
  --credential-file .fleetd/piler.token
cargo run -- agent add --name weaver --metadata '{"harness":"codex"}' \
  --credential-file .fleetd/weaver.token
```

Each response contains `agent.id` but omits the raw token when a credential file
is requested. fleetd never overwrites an existing credential file.

Create a channel containing both IDs:

```sh
cargo run -- channel create --name gooir-001 \
  --member Piler_ID --member Weaver_ID
```

Watch it from one process:

```sh
cargo run -- --token-file .fleetd/weaver.token message watch \
  --channel CHANNEL_ID
```

Then send a durable message from another:

```sh
cargo run -- --token-file .fleetd/piler.token message send \
  --channel CHANNEL_ID --to Weaver_ID --text 'review commit 5fe343f'
```

Weaver's adapter can atomically lease the message:

```sh
cargo run -- --token-file .fleetd/weaver.token inbox claim \
  --agent Weaver_ID --limit 1 --lease-ms 300000
```

After completing the work, it acknowledges the returned message and lease IDs:

```sh
cargo run -- --token-file .fleetd/weaver.token inbox ack --agent Weaver_ID \
  --message MESSAGE_ID --lease LEASE_TOKEN
```

If processing fails, `inbox retry` releases the delivery with a delay and
diagnostic message. If the worker disappears, the lease expires and another
worker can claim the delivery with an incremented attempt count.

Every message also accepts a machine-readable JSON payload, a semantic `kind`,
and optional correlation and causation IDs.

## Security boundary

Every versioned API request requires an operator or agent-bound bearer
credential. Administrative actions require the operator. Inbox operations are
restricted to the credential's agent, and message attribution is constructed by
the server rather than accepted from request data. Raw tokens are returned once
and stored only in owner-readable files; SQLite contains cryptographic digests.

The daemon still rejects non-loopback listen addresses. Authentication is not a
substitute for encrypted transport, so remote workers remain unsupported until
TLS and enrollment are designed.

[protocol](docs/PROTOCOL.md), and [milestones](docs/MILESTONES.md) for the
intended boundaries and next slices.
